# Friday13
Some code to count number of possible Friday the 13ths that can occur during any year

This silly little project was inspired by an old counting book called *Mathematics of Choice - How to Count without Counting* (1965) by Ivan Niven. The determination of how many Friday the 13ths possible is the very first problem in the book.
